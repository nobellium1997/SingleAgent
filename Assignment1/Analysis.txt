    The highest measured run was a walk distance of 26. Anything higher than this caused the program to crash,
because it required to much overhead to process. When this occurred, memory usage was measured at approximately
2.1 GB. After that, it would stop rising and eventually the program timed out. The maximum 26-distance run
used ~305 MB. This took DFID 78 ms and BFS 2.04 seconds. Smaller runs with distances of 5, 10, and 15 were
recorded by the Activity Manager with usages of 168, 189, and 206 MB respectively. The 5-distance took DFID
2 ms and BFS 5 ms. The 10-distance took DFID 10 ms and BFS 38 ms. Finally, the 15-distance walk took DFID
19 ms and BFS 72 ms.
